Following the assembly of a competitive team of individuals, a robot was built in 72 hours to demonstrate to FIRST Robotics Competition teams a design of a competitive robot for the 2018 competition.

I worked on programming the robot in Java, and the design of the intake system. See more at http://ri3dontario.ca/robot.
