Although this involved seperate programming, math, and chemistry tasks, the main project was to build a robot capable of of placing small, thin, bone-like objects at 3 different vertical levels and 3 different horizontal locations. Our robot accomplished this with 2 DoF and a wrist. It rotated on its base, with a double jointed arm to lift objects to their locations.
