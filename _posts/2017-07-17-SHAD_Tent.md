<header><h2>Tent</h2>
<p>created at SHAD Saskatchewan 2017</p></header>
In a group, a low cost tent was created to contain warmth during the night. Black, garbage bag-like material was placed on top of an 'X' structure created by non-hollow pool noodles, which were held together by piercing bamboo rods through them. Front flaps were pinned to the ground using bamboo.
