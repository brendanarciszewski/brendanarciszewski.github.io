<header><h2>Toilet Paper Dispenser</h2>
<p>a project in MTE 100 and GENE 121</p></header>
This was the final project for these classes. The dispenser dispenses an equivalent number of layers as the number of claps the recipient provides. The dispenser unrolls, folds, and then dispenses the toilet paper. The unit was then incased in white foam board.
