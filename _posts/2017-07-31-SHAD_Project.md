Project: reduce the carbon footprint of humans

Our idea is to source lentils from farmers, hiring a manufacturing facility to produce 3 variants of them. We prototyped and tried these variants. Lentils are some of the most energy efficient plants to grow. They are very healthy, and could be sold at chip bag prices, for the same or more quantity.
