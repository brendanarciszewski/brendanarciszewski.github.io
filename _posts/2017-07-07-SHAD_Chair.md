- A design project to create a low cost chair for disaster relief.

In a group, created a double person chair, where individuals sat back-to-back (photo coming soon). The base was 3 sheets of cardboard that interlocked, in an asterisk pattern. A 4th sheet was placed on top and folded to create a lower-back rest and seat.
